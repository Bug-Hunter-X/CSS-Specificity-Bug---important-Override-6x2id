The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this case, the `.parent .child` selector has higher specificity than `.child`, and therefore overrides the `!important` declaration. This behavior can be unexpected and is sometimes challenging to debug.
