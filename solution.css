The following CSS demonstrates a solution avoiding the unexpected `!important` override:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Alternatively, use a more specific !important if absolutely necessary */
.parent .child {
  color: purple !important;
}
```

By removing the unnecessary `!important` declaration from `.child` or by making it more specific if absolutely needed, we improve readability and prevent unintended behavior caused by specificity conflicts.
