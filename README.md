# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected !important Override

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS related to specificity and the `!important` declaration.  The bug highlights a scenario where a more specific selector overrides a rule with `!important`, which may lead to unexpected styling behavior.  The solution provides a way to mitigate this issue by refactoring the CSS to avoid conflicts.

## Bug Description:

The core issue is the unexpected behavior of `!important` when a more specific selector is used.  A typical developer may expect the `!important` declaration to always take precedence, regardless of specificity. However, this is not always the case.

## Solution:

The proposed solution involves refactoring the CSS to ensure a cleaner, more predictable style hierarchy.  This approach prioritizes clear and maintainable styles over relying on `!important` declarations, which can make debugging difficult.
